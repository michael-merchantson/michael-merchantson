ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world! I'm a seasoned software developer with a journey that began in 1991. My first steps into the world of programming were with COBOL and Basic, languages that laid the foundation for my understanding of code. 

ðŸŽ“ Realizing the importance of formal education in this field, I pursued a Masters in Computer Science, specializing in Software Engineering and Databases. This equipped me with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills needed to excel in the industry.

ðŸ’¼ Since 2004, I've held several software development positions, working on a variety of projects from web applications to advanced, cutting-edge embedded device programming. 

ðŸš€ I'm passionate about using technology to solve complex problems and am always eager to learn and grow. Welcome to my GitHub!
